# InvTrack README

## Introduction

this project uwu ðŸ¥°

## Conventions

- Use emojis in commit messages ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜‡ðŸ¥¶ or else the commit will bounce,

- NO DEFAULT EXPORTS, use named exports only e.g. `export const foo = () => undefined`,

- explicitly define return type of util/global/exported functions,

- `useStyles` hook at the bottom of the file,

- import React in every `.tsx` file,

- where possible, use our own components instead of direct react-native imports,

## Setup

- run `npm i`

- when running on Windows, make sure to set `git config --global core.autocrlf true`

## Usage

- run `npm start`, then choose your desired option from the CLI. Make sure your computer is connected to the same network as the device you want to run the development app on.
