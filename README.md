# Local development

## Notifications

To make notifications work correctly, you have to add the service role key and local project url to the valut, run this from the sql console:
`select vault.create_secret('__insert_service_role_key', 'service_role_key');`
`select vault.create_secret('http://172.17.0.1:54321', 'project_url');`

## Developing supabase edge functions

Be sure to install `Deno`, then the Deno language server extension, then open the `workspace-config.code-workspace` file from the command line.

The project structure will look different, but VSCode will know what runtime to use, and where.
