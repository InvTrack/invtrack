# invtrack README

## Introduction

this project uwu ðŸ¥°

## Environment

- everything regarding envs for local/build/update is defined in `config.ts`

## Conventions

- when you encounter confilcts in package-lock.json, accept the upstream branch version, resolve conflicts in package.json and run `npm i`,

- explicitly define return type of util/global/exported functions,

- where possible, use our own components instead of direct react-native imports,

## Setup

- make sure to use the node version specified in .nvmrc,

- run `npm i`,

- if running on Windows, make sure to disable autocrlf wizardry, prettier takes care of that `git config --global core.autocrlf false`.

## Usage

- run `npm start`, then choose your desired option from the CLI. Make sure your machine is connected to the same network as the device you want to run the development app on.
